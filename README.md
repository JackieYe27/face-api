About The Project:
A backend project involving Express and Node which connects to a postgresql database. We use Knex.js as our query builder of choice to link the server and database. Also we connect to a Clarifai facial recognition API. In order to use the API we must get a Clarifai API and simply input it into controllers/image.js file where key is needed.
